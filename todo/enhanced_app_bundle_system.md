# Enhanced App Bundle System - Remaining Tasks Checklist

This document outlines the remaining tasks for implementing the Enhanced App Bundle System, based on the status check of `ENHANCED_APP_BUNDLE_SYSTEM_PLAN.md`.

## I. Phase 1: Enhanced App Manifest & Scheduled Jobs (Core Implementation)

- [ ] **1.2 Parse Cloud Jobs Integration**:
    - [ ] Implement the backend logic for registering and managing scheduled jobs for applications. This typically involves creating or modifying `parse-server/cloud/functions/scheduledJobs.js` (currently missing), and integrating with Parse's job scheduling mechanisms.
- [ ] **1.3 Job Management UI**:
    - [ ] Ensure `src/components/app-framework/JobManager.tsx` provides comprehensive UI for managing scheduled jobs specifically defined within app manifests, including creation, editing, viewing status, and logging. (While `JobManager.tsx` exists, its full functionality for app-specific scheduled jobs needs to be confirmed against the plan's details).

## II. Phase 2: Database Triggers System (Core Implementation)

- [ ] **2.1 Trigger Registration Engine**:
    - [ ] Implement the backend system for registering and executing app-specific database triggers. This involves creating `parse-server/cloud/functions/triggerManagement.js` (currently missing) and integrating with Parse's `beforeSave`, `afterSave`, `beforeDelete`, `afterDelete` hooks.
- [ ] **2.2 Trigger Management UI**:
    - [ ] Create the React component `src/components/app-framework/TriggerManager.tsx` (currently missing) for managing database triggers within app admin interfaces, allowing for defining conditions and linking to cloud functions.

## III. Phase 3: Custom Code Deployment Pipeline (Core Implementation)

- [ ] **3.1 Build System Architecture**: (This is a conceptual architectural phase outlined in the plan. Concrete implementation follows.)
- [ ] **3.2 Build System Implementation**:
    - [ ] Implement the Webpack-based (or similar) build system for compiling and bundling app code. This requires creating `parse-server/cloud/build-system/builder.js` (currently missing).
- [ ] **3.3 Secure Runtime Sandbox**:
    - [ ] Implement the isolated execution environment for app code with resource monitoring and security controls. This requires creating `parse-server/cloud/app-runtime/sandbox.js` (currently missing).

## IV. Phase 4: Inter-App Communication Framework (Core Implementation)

- [ ] **4.1 App Registry & Discovery**:
    - [ ] Implement the service for app discovery, API registration, and secure inter-app communication. This requires creating `src/services/appCommunication.ts` (currently missing).
- [ ] **4.2 Event-Driven Architecture**:
    - [ ] Implement the event bus system for asynchronous communication between applications. This requires creating `src/services/appEvents.ts` (currently missing).
- [ ] **4.3 Message Bus System**: (This is primarily a conceptual diagram in the plan. Its concrete implementation ties into 4.1 and 4.2.)

## V. Phase 5: Enhanced App Bundle Management (Core Implementation)

- [ ] **5.1 Bundle Validation Engine**:
    - [ ] Implement the comprehensive validation system for app bundles, including manifest validation, security scanning, and dependency checking. This requires creating `parse-server/cloud/functions/bundleValidation.js` (currently missing).
- [ ] **5.2 Installation Orchestrator**: (This is a conceptual sequence diagram in the plan, implying the orchestration logic based on the implemented Phases 1-4).

## VI. Missing Files (Backend Core)

- [ ] `parse-server/cloud/functions/scheduledJobs.js`
- [ ] `parse-server/cloud/functions/triggerManagement.js`
- [ ] `parse-server/cloud/build-system/builder.js`
- [ ] `parse-server/cloud/app-runtime/sandbox.js`
- [ ] `parse-server/cloud/functions/bundleValidation.js`

## VII. Missing Files (Frontend Core)

- [ ] `src/components/app-framework/TriggerManager.tsx`
- [ ] `src/services/appCommunication.ts`
- [ ] `src/services/appEvents.ts`
