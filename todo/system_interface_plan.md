# SYSTEM_INTERFACE_PLAN.md - What Remains to Perform

This plan is largely a conceptual outline, and its full implementation requires significant work across multiple modules, particularly those related to the app framework, multi-tenancy, and various administrative UIs.

*   **System Administration Interface (2.1)**:
    -   [ ] **Full App Store Management**: Implement backend (Parse schemas, cloud functions for `AppDefinition`, `AppVersion`, `AppReview` lifecycle) and frontend UI for end-to-end app review, approval, publishing, versioning, and listing management.
    -   [ ] **Comprehensive Global Organization Management UI**: Complete the frontend for `GlobalOrgManager.tsx` to handle creation, suspension, activation, deletion of organizations, and provide a full dashboard for monitoring org health, status, and resource consumption.
    -   [ ] **Comprehensive Global User Management UI**: Complete the frontend for `GlobalUserManager.tsx` to manage System Administrator accounts, oversee user accounts across all orgs (global policy enforcement), and fully define/manage global roles and permissions.
    -   [ ] **Advanced Platform Configuration & Monitoring**: Develop comprehensive UIs and backend logic for system-wide settings (integrations, security policies, feature flags), performance monitoring, detailed logging, and billing/subscription models.

*   **Standard Organization Interface (2.2.1)**:
    -   [ ] **Enhanced App Marketplace Integration**: Complete the backend (secure app bundle handling, installation logic) and frontend UI for full app installation, update, configuration, and uninstallation within an organization.
    -   [ ] **Advanced Org User Management UI**: Refine the `Users.tsx` page to include robust UIs for inviting users, managing complex org-specific roles and permissions, and advanced deactivation workflows.
    -   [ ] **Comprehensive Org Settings**: Expand `src/pages/settings.tsx` and `src/components/settings/OrganizationSettings.tsx` to extensively manage org-specific data, resources, integrations, and display detailed billing/subscription info.
    -   [ ] **Collaboration & Communication Tools**: Implement features for intra-organization collaboration and communication, if part of the roadmap.

*   **Parent / Issuing Org Interface (2.2.2)**:
    -   [ ] **Automated Org Provisioning & Configuration**: Implement comprehensive UI/workflow for automated provisioning and configuration of new customer organizations, including a dedicated dashboard for monitoring all issued organizations.
    -   [ ] **Marketing Content Management System (CMS)**: Develop CMS-like capabilities for System Admins to create and manage public-facing marketing website content (landing pages, feature descriptions, pricing).
    -   [ ] **Advanced User/Org Signup Management**: Create robust UIs for designing multiple signup forms, and fully implement backend processing of new registrations, integrated with the Parent Org dashboard.
    -   [ ] **Marketing Analytics & Reporting**: Develop dedicated analytics and reporting features to track effectiveness of marketing campaigns and signup conversions within the Parent Org context.

*   **Application Administration UIs (2.3)**:
    -   [ ] **Framework for Dynamic App Admin UIs**: Implement a standardized, dynamic, and extensible framework that allows installed applications to expose their own administrative UIs within the platform. This will likely involve advanced dynamic component loading from app bundles and specific design patterns for app-defined interfaces.
    -   [ ] **Implementation of Core App Admin UI Features**: Within this framework, facilitate the implementation of common app-specific administration functionalities such as application-specific configuration, data management, internal user access control, app-specific dashboards/analytics, integration settings, and workflow management.
