# Multi-Organization Users Page - Remaining Tasks Checklist

This document outlines the remaining tasks for implementing comprehensive multi-organization support for the Users page, based on the status check of `MULTI_ORG_USERS_PAGE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

## I. Phase 3: Frontend Organization State Management (Critical Issues Remain)

- [ ] **Restore `fetchUserOrganizations` in `OrganizationSelector`**:
    - [ ] Uncomment and ensure the `useEffect` block in `src/components/layout/OrganizationSelector.tsx` (lines 36-51 in the reviewed file) actively calls `dispatch(fetchUserOrganizations())` to fetch user organizations when the component mounts and user is authenticated.
- [ ] **Implement Advanced Error Handling (Frontend)**:
    - [ ] Enhance the `orgSlice.ts` thunks (`fetchUserOrganizations`, `setCurrentOrganization`, etc.) to incorporate robust retry logic with exponential backoff (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s delays) and a circuit breaker pattern (e.g., stop retrying after 3 consecutive failures), as outlined in the plan's "Error Handling Strategy".

## II. Phase 4: Users Page Organization Integration (Verification)

- [ ] **Verify Users Page Scoping**:
    - [ ] Conduct comprehensive testing to confirm that the Users page (`src/pages/users.tsx` and related components) correctly displays only users belonging to the currently selected organization.
    - [ ] Verify that the user list automatically updates when the organization is switched via the `OrganizationSelector`.
    - [ ] Ensure that all user invitation and management actions within the Users page correctly apply the current organization's context.
- [ ] **Verify AI Assistant Integration**:
    - [ ] Confirm through testing that all AI assistant actions related to user management correctly include the necessary organization context in their metadata.
    - [ ] Validate that the AI assistant can successfully access and execute organization-scoped user management actions.

## III. General Improvements (As per plan's suggestions)

- [ ] **Performance Optimizations**:
    - [ ] Implement caching strategy for the organization list (e.g., for 5 minutes).
    - [ ] Implement lazy loading for organization details where appropriate.
    - [ ] Apply debouncing to prevent rapid organization switching requests.
    - [ ] Consider optimistic UI updates for organization-related actions.
- [ ] **Backend Error Handling**:
    - [ ] Ensure all Parse Cloud functions in `parse-server/cloud/functions/organizations.js` and other relevant backend functions perform robust validation of all organization IDs against user memberships.
    - [ ] Verify that meaningful error messages are returned for unauthorized access attempts.
    - [ ] Confirm that all organization switching attempts are logged for auditing purposes.
    - [ ] Handle edge cases such as a user being removed from an organization or an organization being deleted.
