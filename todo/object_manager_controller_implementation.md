# Object Manager Controller Implementation - Remaining Tasks Checklist

This document outlines the remaining tasks for implementing the Object Manager Controller, based on the status check of `OBJECT_MANAGER_CONTROLLER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

## I. Phase 1: Create ObjectManagerPageController (Action Expansion & Backend Integration)

- [ ] **1.1 Controller Action Expansion**:
    - [ ] Implement the following additional actions within `src/controllers/ObjectManagerPageController.ts` by calling the corresponding methods in `objectManagerService.ts`:
        - [ ] `updateObject` (for modifying existing object definitions).
        - [ ] `deleteObject` (for removing custom objects and their data).
        - [ ] `getObjectDetails` (for retrieving detailed object information including fields).
        - [ ] `searchObjects` (for advanced search and filtering on objects, if different from `fetchObjects`'s `searchTerm`).
        - [ ] `addField` (for adding new fields to existing objects).
        - [ ] `updateField` (for modifying field definitions).
        - [ ] `deleteField` (for removing fields from objects).
        - [ ] `getFieldTypes` (for getting available field types and their configurations).
        - [ ] `searchRecords` (for advanced search within an object's records).
        - [ ] `bulkUpdateRecords` (for updating multiple records at once).
        - [ ] `bulkDeleteRecords` (for deleting multiple records at once).
        - [ ] `getObjectSchema` (for getting the Parse schema definition of an object).
        - [ ] `validateObjectSchema` (for validating object schema before creation/update).
        - [ ] `migrateObjectSchema` (for handling schema migrations).
- [ ] **1.2 Real Data Integration (Backend Cloud Functions for Schema/Object Management - CRITICAL!)**:
    - [ ] Implement the necessary Parse Cloud Functions in `parse-server/cloud/functions/` that are called by `src/services/objectManagerService.ts` for schema and object management operations:
        - [ ] `deleteObjectSchemaAndData` (called by `objectManagerService.deleteObject`).
        - [ ] `addFieldToObjectSchema` (called by `objectManagerService.addFieldToObject`).
        - [ ] `updateFieldInObjectSchema` (called by `objectManagerService.updateFieldInObject`).
        - [ ] `removeFieldFromObjectSchema` (called by `objectManagerService.deleteFieldFromObject`).

## II. Phase 2: Update Objects Component (Completing UI Data Integration)

- [ ] **2.2 Enhanced Functionality / Replace Mock Fallback Data**:
    - [ ] In `src/components/pages/Objects.tsx`, remove the static mock data from the `fallbackObjects` `useQuery` (lines 41-89). Instead, if the controller is not registered or fails, ensure the fallback properly fetches real object data from a Parse list API.
    - [ ] Implement UI elements and logic for any newly available actions (e.g., managing object definitions, fields) through the `ObjectManagerPageController`.

## III. Phase 3: Update ObjectRecordViewer Component (CRITICAL & Major Rework)

- [ ] **3.1 Controller Integration**:
    - [ ] Modify `src/components/object-manager/ObjectRecordViewer.tsx` to integrate with the `ObjectManagerPageController`. It should utilize the controller's actions (e.g., `fetchRecords`, `createRecord`, `updateRecord`, `deleteRecord`).
- [ ] **3.1 Real Data Integration for Records/Fields**:
    - [ ] Completely replace the mock data for `records` (lines 41-69) and `fields` (lines 71-100) within `src/components/object-manager/ObjectRecordViewer.tsx`. All data fetching for records and their field definitions must now be performed via `ObjectManagerPageController` (which uses `objectManagerService` for real data).
- [ ] **3.2 Enhanced Record Management**:
    - [ ] Implement advanced features within `ObjectRecordViewer.tsx` such as:
        - [ ] Advanced search and filtering for records.
        - [ ] Bulk record operations (e.g., using the `bulkUpdateRecords` and `bulkDeleteRecords` actions from the controller).
        - [ ] Export/import functionality for records.
        - [ ] UI for managing field-level permissions if the controller supports them.
    - [ ] Implement proper pagination for large datasets within the records table of `ObjectRecordViewer.tsx`.
