# TODO_CHECKLIST.md - What Remains to Perform (Self-Correction)
This document is a high-level checklist based on initial project reviews. My detailed analysis of individual implementation plans (`AI_ASSISTANT_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`, `APP_FRAMEWORK_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md`, `BLOCKCHAIN_IMPORT_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`, `COMPREHENSIVE_CONTROLLER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `DFNS_PERSONA_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`, `ENHANCED_APP_BUNDLE_SYSTEM_PLAN.md`, `ENHANCED_PAGE_BUILDER_COMPONENT_LIBRARY_PLAN.md`, `EVM_CONTRACT_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md`, `FINDINGS.md`, `INDEXING_PLAN.md`, `MOCK_API_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `MULTI_ORG_USERS_PAGE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `OBJECT_MANAGER_CONTROLLER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `ORGANIZATION_ID_CONTEXT_FIX_PLAN.md`, `ORGANIZATION_THEMING_SYSTEM_PLAN.md`, `PARSE_SERVER_POSTGRESQL_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`, `PARSE_SERVER_TENANT_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`, `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`, `PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `Refactoring Plan.md`, `SCHEMA_CREATION_ANALYSIS.md`, `SYSTEM_INTERFACE_PLAN.md`, `UNIFIED_CONTROLLER_REGISTRY_PLAN.md`, `UNIFIED_CONTROLLER_REGISTRY_README.md`, `USERS_PAGE_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md`, `USERS_PAGE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`) has revealed numerous discrepancies.

Therefore, the remaining tasks are to update this `TODO_CHECKLIST.md` document itself to accurately reflect the true "Completed" and "To-Do" items based on the more granular analysis.

*   **System Architecture & Planning**:
    -   [ ] Review and update statuses for `System Interface Plan` and `Project Implementation Plan` to reflect actual current state (e.g., many sub-components are still incomplete, despite the high-level plan being 'created').
    -   [ ] Correct the status for `AI Org Assistant Design` and `Blockchain Import System Design` to reflect which *components* within those designs are actually implemented versus conceptual.
    -   [ ] Verify and update `App Initialization Plan` status, ensuring all phases (especially artifact import and Parent Org creation) are truly completed or marked as pending based on `APP_INITIALIZATION_PLAN.md`'s specific findings.

*   **Implementation - Phase 1 Blockchain Import**:
    -   [ ] Validate each item in this section. My analysis of `BLOCKCHAIN_IMPORT_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` indicates that only Phase 1 (System Admin Contract Import, Backend Services like `blockchainService.js`) was complete, features like Contract deployment, write operations & advanced features were explicitly marked as "Not yet implemented". The checklist should reflect this nuance.

*   **Initial UI Scaffolding**:
    -   [ ] Confirm the "completeness" of these items (e.g., System Admin Interface, Organization Dashboard, InstalledAppsWidget). Many UI components exist as scaffolding but lack full backend integration. Update the checklist to reflect if functionality is truly complete or just the UI component exists.
    -   [ ] Re-evaluate `System Admin Permission Flow` status. My analysis of `FINDINGS.md` and related plans found that security fixes are largely **INCOMPLETE**.

*   **PageBuilder Integration**:
    -   [ ] Re-assess the completeness of all PageBuilder items, especially `Dynamic component integration` and `Cloud storage export/import`. My analysis of `ENHANCED_PAGE_BUILDER_COMPONENT_LIBRARY_PLAN.md` showed that the vast majority of `Enhanced Page Builder` features are **not implemented**. Update this section to reflect the actual state.

*   **System Admin Backend Implementation**:
    -   [ ] **Global Organization Management**: Re-evaluate `GlobalOrgManager UI component with full integration`. While backend functions for `Global Org Management` exist, the frontend UI for comprehensive global org management is still largely incomplete based on `PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
    -   [ ] **Global User Management**: Re-evaluate `GlobalUserManager UI component with full integration`. Similar to org management, the UI is still incomplete.

*   **Organization Interfaces Enhancement**:
    -   [ ] **Standard Organization Interface**:
        -   [ ] `InstalledAppsWidget` needs verification of `getInstalledAppsForOrg` cloud function's full data integration.
        -   [ ] `App Marketplace` enhancements (`installAppInOrg`, `uninstallAppFromOrg`, `updateAppInOrg`, `AppConsentDialog`) are explicitly incomplete based on `MOCK_API_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` and `APP_FRAMEWORK_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md`. Update status.
        -   [ ] `Org Settings & User Management` (org profile, org-specific roles, settings persistence) should reflect if the components are fully functional with backend or just placeholders.
    -   [ ] **Parent/Issuing Org Interface**: Many items here (Org Lifecycle Management, Marketing CMS, Signup Management interface) were identified as significantly incomplete or conceptual in `SYSTEM_INTERFACE_PLAN.md`, `PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, and `APP_INITIALIZATION_PLAN.md`. This section needs substantial correction.

*   **AI Org Assistant Implementation**:
    -   [ ] Re-assess `SchemaRegistry` (manual configuration and versioning are missing).
    -   [ ] Confirm `LLMProxy` (needs API key).
    -   [ ] Re-verify the `ToolExecutor` and `comprehensive tool library`. While many tools are listed as complete, the broader context of `AI_ASSISTANT_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` and `AI_ORG_ASSISTANT_DESIGN.md` implies continued development for multi-provider orchestration and enhanced action execution.

*   **Application Framework (Phase 3)**:
    -   [ ] This section claims "✅ COMPLETE". My analysis of `APP_FRAMEWORK_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md` and `ENHANCED_APP_BUNDLE_SYSTEM_PLAN.md` revealed that the majority of backend implementation for advanced features like scheduled jobs, triggers, custom code deployment, inter-app communication, and bundle validation is **missing**. This needs to be critically re-evaluated.

*   **Chain Configuration & Contract Deployment**:
    -   [ ] Re-verify "✅ COMPLETE (Just implemented)". While some functions are in place, `EVM_CONTRACT_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md` explicitly stated that fundamental data management and storage for `evmNetworks.json` and `evm-deployments/` were **missing**, preventing UI functionality. The checklist should reflect this critical dependency.

*   **Documentation & Testing**:
    -   [ ] Update the documentation status. While many docs are listed complete, actual code implementations often contradict these.
    -   [ ] Critically evaluate the "Unit tests for critical components" and "Integration tests for workflows" claims. Based on project analysis, test coverage is likely minimal or non-existent in many areas.

*   **DevOps & Infrastructure**:
    -   [ ] All items in this section are marked as `[ ]`, correctly indicating they are outstanding tasks.

*   **Overall Synchronization**:
    -   [ ] Review the "Notes" section at the end of the `TODO_CHECKLIST.md` and update it to provide a more accurate, consolidated summary of the project's actual status, drawing directly from the detailed `todo` files created for each individual plan.
