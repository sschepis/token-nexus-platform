# Lottie Animation Integration - Remaining Tasks Checklist

This document outlines the remaining tasks for the comprehensive Lottie animation integration in the Token Nexus Platform, based on the status check of `LOTTIE_ANIMATION_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`.

## Phase 2: Animation Categories & Strategic Locations (Widespread Integration)

- [ ] **Loading States:** Systematically integrate the `LoadingAnimation` component into all specified UI locations:
    - [ ] Token list (`src/pages/tokens/index.tsx`)
    - [ ] Dashboard widgets (`src/pages/dashboard.tsx`)
    - [ ] Marketplace app loading (`src/pages/marketplace.tsx`)
    - [ ] Critical form processing areas (e.g., `src/components/token/TokenForm.tsx`, `src/pages/login.tsx`)

- [ ] **Success/Error Feedback (Comprehensive Integration):**
    - [ ] Implement full integration of success and error Lottie animations into all form validation workflows throughout the platform.
    - [ ] Enhance system notifications (toast messages, dialogs, status badges) with animated notification icons and transitions.

- [ ] **Interactive Elements (Beyond Buttons):**
    - [ ] Integrate Lottie for smooth animated transitions within navigation elements (menu items, tabs, breadcrumbs).
    - [ ] Apply Lottie animations to data visualization components, such as dashboard charts and progress indicators.

## Phase 4: Performance Optimization Strategy (Verification & Full Implementation)

- [ ] Conduct a comprehensive application-wide audit and verification to ensure all animations adhere to the implemented lazy loading, preloading, caching, and fallback strategies.
- [ ] Implement active monitoring of performance metrics (memory, battery, frame rate) to ensure optimal network performance for animations.

## Phase 5: Integration Points & Migration Strategy (Full Adoption)

- [ ] Systematically replace all existing pulse animations, static loading texts, and basic skeleton screens with their Lottie-enabled counterparts across the entire application.
- [ ] Ensure specific enhancements for form interactions, beyond the `AnimatedButton`, such as detailed progress indicators in `src/components/token/TokenForm.tsx` and animated validation feedback in `Login` forms.
- [ ] Implement real-time animated updates for transaction statuses, system health, and enhanced toast notifications.
- [ ] Integrate Lottie animations to enrich user feedback in modal dialogs and general data update transitions.

## Phase 8: Performance & Accessibility Considerations (Ongoing Adherence)

- [ ] Conduct thorough accessibility testing to ensure all Lottie implementations meet WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, including proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and focus management.
- [ ] Implement continuous cross-browser compatibility testing and a robust polyfill strategy to ensure consistent animation behavior across all target browsers.
