# Code Refactoring - Remaining Tasks Checklist

This document outlines the remaining tasks for implementing the Code Refactoring Plan, based on the status check of `Refactoring Plan.md`. While initial progress has been made on modularization, significant work remains across all phases.

## I. Phase 2: File Refactoring and Modularization (General Application)

- [ ] **General Codebase Review**: Systematically re-examine the entire `src/` directory (excluding `src/config/` and generated/external files) to identify other files or code blocks that would benefit from logical separation, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). Areas to specifically target include:
    - [ ] Any single `Component.tsx` file exporting multiple, distinct React components or containing deeply nested helper components that could be extracted.
    - [ ] Any `utils.ts` or `helpers.ts` files that serve as catch-alls for a wide array of unrelated functions.
    - [ ] Files containing large switch statements or complex conditional logic that could be refactored into more maintainable patterns (e.g., Strategy Pattern).
- [ ] **Component/Module Extraction**: For all identified areas, break them down into smaller, more focused modules:
    - [ ] **React Components**: Separate individual, reusable React components into their own dedicated files (e.g., `SubComponentA.tsx`).
    - [ ] **Hooks**: Extract custom React hooks that encapsulate reusable logic into appropriate `hooks/` directories (e.g., `useAuth.ts`, `useDataFetching.ts`).
    - [ ] **Utility Functions**: Group related utility functions into specific, domain-named utility files (e.g., `src/utils/date.ts`, `src/utils/validation.ts`, `src/utils/api-helpers.ts`).
    - [ ] **Interfaces/Types**: Define interfaces and types in shared `types/` or `interfaces/` files for global or widely used types, or co-locate them with specific components/modules.
    - [ ] **Services/Managers**: Extract business logic or complex data handling into dedicated service or manager files (e.g., `src/services/auth.ts`, `src/managers/preferences.ts`).
- [ ] **Directory Structure Optimization**: Ensure that all newly created files and modules are placed within a logical, hierarchical, and intuitive directory structure that reflects the application's domain and architecture (e.g., `feature-name/pages/`, `feature-name/components/`).

## II. Phase 3: Code Enhancement and Deduplication (DRY Principle)

- [ ] **Pattern Recognition & Abstraction**:
    - [ ] Use `search_files` with targeted regex patterns to identify duplicate code blocks, repeated logic, or similar patterns across different modules and components (e.g., repeated API call structures, common validation logic, similar UI rendering).
    - [ ] Extract common, reusable logic into shared helper functions, utility classes, or new, specialized modules. Consider applying Higher-Order Components (HOCs) or custom hooks for shared React UI logic where appropriate.
- [ ] **Centralized Configuration/Constants**:
    - [ ] Identify and centralize constants, configuration values, and "magic strings" (e.g., API endpoints, error messages, hardcoded values) into a designated constants file (e.g., `src/constants/app.ts`) or a consolidated configuration object (e.g., `src/config/app.ts`).
- [ ] **Error Handling Standardization**:
    - [ ] Implement a consistent and standardized error handling mechanism across the application. This may involve:
        - [ ] Defining a consistent error logging strategy.
        - [ ] Utilizing custom error classes.
        - [ ] Implementing a universal error handling component or hook for user-friendly error messages.
- [ ] **Performance Optimization (Light Touch)**:
    - [ ] Identify and implement minor performance improvements without significantly re-architecting core logic (e.g., using `React.memo`, `useCallback`, `useMemo` hooks for React components; optimizing large data transformations or loops).
- [ ] **TSDoc Comments**:
    - [ ] For all new and modified code during this phase, ensure strict adherence to the TSDoc commenting style, including `@param`, `@returns`, `@example` tags.
    - [ ] Add or improve comments in existing code where clarity is needed, focusing on explaining the "why" behind the code.

## III. Phase 4: Finalization and Output

- [ ] **Documentation (Refactoring Report)**:
    - [ ] Create a comprehensive `Refactoring Report.md` file in the root directory. This report should systematically outline:
        - [ ] The initial state of the codebase.
        - [ ] The rationale behind key refactoring decisions.
        - [ ] A summary of specific changes made (e.g., list of new files, re-organized directories, key code snippets).
        - [ ] Any identified architectural patterns or principles applied.
        - [ ] Instructions on how to verify the refactored code (running tests, setup steps).
- [ ] **Testing and Verification**:
    - [ ] Clearly emphasize the critical importance of a thorough testing process by the user after the refactoring is complete.
    - [ ] Recommend running existing unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure no regressions were introduced.
    - [ ] Suggest manual testing of key user flows if automated tests are limited.
- [ ] **Code Review Guidelines**:
    - [ ] Provide suggestions for areas to focus on during a self or peer code review process for the refactored code (e.g., verifying new module boundaries, adherence to SRP and DRY, TSDoc comments, performance).
