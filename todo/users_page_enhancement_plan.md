# USERS_PAGE_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md - What Remains to Perform
This document outlines a comprehensive plan to enhance the Users page with full feature enhancement and AI assistant integration. While basic functionalities are present and the controller has been initiated, significant work remains to fully implement all proposed features and integrations.

*   **Current State - Missing Features**: All features listed in the document's "Missing Features" section are still outstanding, unless specifically completed as part of a later phase.
    -   [ ] Advanced filtering and sorting
    -   [ ] Bulk operations
    -   [ ] User import/export
    -   [ ] Pagination for large user lists
    -   [ ] Audit logging
    -   [ ] Enhanced permission controls (beyond basic role assignment)
    -   [ ] Better error handling and loading states

*   **Phase 1: Action Registry Integration**:
    -   [ ] **Comprehensive Action Definitions in `src/controllers/UsersPageController.ts`**: Ensure all proposed actions (`viewUsers`, `searchUsers`, `filterUsers`, `inviteUser`, `updateRoles`, `suspendUser`, `activateUser`, `exportUsers`, `bulkInvite`, `viewUserDetails`, `removeUser`, `assignAdminRole`) are fully defined with parameters, descriptions, and metadata within `src/controllers/UsersPageController.ts`. This includes proper `AI Allowed` flags and `Restrictions`.
    -   [ ] **Permission System Enhancement for Users Page**: Implement specific role-based restrictions for admin role changes, add approval workflows for sensitive operations (e.g., suspend, activate, remove user), create a detailed audit trail for all user management actions, and explicitly block specific actions from AI execution as outlined.

*   **Phase 2: UI/UX Enhancements**:
    -   [ ] **Advanced Search & Filtering (`src/components/user/UserSearchFilters.tsx`)**: Implement multi-field search, advanced filters (role, status, join date, last login), saved filter presets, real-time search with debouncing, and filter persistence. This component does not currently exist.
    -   [ ] **Bulk Operations (`src/components/user/UserBulkOperations.tsx`)**: Implement bulk user selection, bulk invite, bulk role updates (with restrictions), bulk export, and progress tracking for bulk operations. This component does not currently exist.
    -   [ ] **Import/Export Functionality (`src/components/user/UserImportExport.tsx`)**: Implement CSV/Excel import with validation, template download, export to various formats, import progress tracking, error reporting, data validation, and conflict resolution. This component does not currently exist.
    -   [ ] **Pagination & Performance**: Implement server-side pagination, configurable page sizes, virtual scrolling, loading states/skeleton screens, and optimistic updates. This involves updates to `src/pages/users.tsx` and related data fetching logic.

*   **Phase 3: Enhanced Components**:
    -   [ ] **User Table Enhancements (`src/components/user/EnhancedUserTable.tsx`)**: Implement sortable/resizable columns, column visibility controls, row selection, inline editing, and keyboard navigation. This component does not currently exist, or needs to be a significant enhancement to `src/pages/users.tsx`'s existing table.
    -   [ ] **User Detail Enhancements (`src/components/user/EnhancedUserDetailView.tsx`)**: Implement activity timeline, permission matrix view, login/organization membership history, security settings overview, and profile completion status. This component requires significant enhancement to `src/components/user/UserDetailView.tsx`.
    -   [ ] **Audit Logging Component (`src/components/user/UserAuditLog.tsx`)**: Implement action history tracking, change diff visualization, filterable audit trail, export audit logs, and AI action identification. This component does not currently exist.

*   **Phase 4: Backend Integration**:
    -   [ ] **Enhanced Redux State Management (`src/store/slices/userSlice.ts`)**: Update the `userSlice.ts` to include new state structures for `pagination`, `filters`, `bulkOperations`, and `auditLogs`, and ensure proper `isLoadingAuditLogs` flags.
    -   [ ] **New Async Thunks**: Implement all new async thunks: `bulkInviteUsers`, `bulkUpdateRoles`, `exportUsers`, `importUsers`, `fetchAuditLogs`, and `searchUsersAdvanced`. These will require corresponding cloud functions in `parse-server`.

*   **Phase 5: AI Assistant Integration**:
    -   [ ] **Complete AI Action Integration**: Fully implement natural language action discovery for user management (e.g., "Show me all developers who joined last month"), ensure AI execution metadata is added to audit logs, and support complex natural language queries.
    -   [ ] **Robust AI Safety & Permissions**: Reconfirm the full implementation of blocking admin role assignments and user removal via AI, requiring human approval for sensitive operations, comprehensive audit trails for AI actions, and rate limiting for AI-initiated actions within the `PermissionManager.ts` and `UsersPageController.ts`.

*   **General**:
    -   [ ] **Performance Requirements**: Ensure the page meets specified performance requirements (load time, search results, bulk operations, real-time updates).
    -   [ ] **Security Requirements**: Verify that all actions pass through permission validation, AI actions are logged with special metadata, and all blocking/approval mechanisms are functional.
    -   [ ] **Accessibility Requirements**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and high contrast mode support are met.
