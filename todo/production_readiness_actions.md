# Production Readiness - Immediate Action Plan Checklist

This document outlines the immediate actions required to address critical issues and move the Token Nexus Platform towards production readiness, based on the `FINDINGS.md` document.

## I. Phase 1 - Critical Security Fixes (REQUIRED)

- [ ] **1. Remove/Secure Development Tools**:
    - [ ] Implement access control to move all pages within the `/dev/*` directory (e.g., `src/pages/dev/debug-settings.tsx`, `src/pages/dev/api-testing.tsx`, `src/pages/dev/auth-tester.tsx`, `src/pages/dev/database-explorer.tsx`, `src/pages/dev/env-manager.tsx`, `src/pages/dev/logs-viewer.tsx`, `src/pages/dev/network-inspector.tsx`, `src/pages/dev/performance-monitor.tsx`, `src/pages/dev/storage-explorer.tsx`) behind strict system admin-only access or remove them entirely from production builds.
    - [ ] Add explicit production environment checks (e.g., `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'`) to disable or hide development-only features and routes.
    - [ ] Remove debug settings functionality from production builds where sensitive information might be exposed.
    - [ ] Delete example files not intended for production environments, such as `src/pages/system-admin/dfns-management-example.tsx`.
- [ ] **2. Clean Debug Code**:
    - [ ] Systematically review and remove all `console.log` statements throughout the codebase, particularly those identified in `src/pages/_app.tsx`, `src/pages/dev/debug-settings.tsx`, and `src/pages/api/setup/complete-initial-setup.ts`, that expose internal Parse SDK state or debug information.
    - [ ] Identify and clean up any other development artifacts or debug information leakage across the application.
- [ ] **3. Fix API Dependencies**:
    - [ ] Replace file system operations in API routes (e.g., `src/pages/api/app-status.ts`, `src/pages/api/setup/update-platform-state.ts`) with database operations for persistent storage and compatibility with serverless/cloud environments.
    - [ ] Eliminate all mock API usage in production code that leads to non-functional features (e.g., in `src/pages/dashboard.tsx`, `src/pages/marketplace.tsx`). Transition to real API endpoints or implement proper data fetching.
    - [ ] Implement robust environment-based configuration for API endpoints to ensure correct behavior in different deployment environments.
    - [ ] Remove test-specific API endpoints from production builds, such as `src/pages/api/test-status.ts`.

## II. Phase 2 - Performance Optimization

- [ ] **1. Implement Code Splitting**:
    - [ ] Introduce dynamic imports for large and heavy components (e.g., GrapesJS, Ethers.js, any chart libraries) to reduce initial bundle size.
    - [ ] Implement route-based code splitting to load only the necessary code for a given page.
    - [ ] Apply lazy loading strategies, especially for any development tools retained in non-production environments.
- [ ] **2. Bundle Optimization**:
    - [ ] Configure build processes to perform tree shaking for large JavaScript libraries to remove unused code.
    - [ ] Optimize the loading and initialization of GrapesJS to minimize its performance impact.
    - [ ] Implement a comprehensive caching strategy for static assets and frequently accessed components.

## III. Phase 3 - Production Hardening

- [ ] **1. Environment Configuration**:
    - [ ] Establish clear and robust separation between production and development configurations (e.g., using `.env.production`, environment-specific build steps).
    - [ ] Implement environment-specific feature flags to control feature rollout.
    - [ ] Set up secure configuration management best practices (e.g., avoiding hardcoding secrets, using secrets management services).
- [ ] **2. Monitoring & Logging**:
    - [ ] Implement production-safe logging practices, ensuring sensitive data is not logged and log verbosity is appropriate for production.
    - [ ] Integrate robust error tracking systems (e.g., Sentry, Bugsnag) to capture and report production errors.
    - [ ] Configure performance monitoring tools (e.g., New Relic, Datadog) to track application performance, response times, and resource utilization in production.
