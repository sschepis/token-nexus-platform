# Blockchain Contract Import & Management System - Remaining Design Implementation

This document outlines the remaining tasks for implementing the design of the Blockchain Contract Import & Management System, based on the `BLOCKCHAIN_IMPORT_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` document and its companion `BLOCKCHAIN_IMPORT_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`.

## I. Phase 2: Organization Contract Management

- [ ] **Network Configuration Implementation**:
    - [ ] Develop `src/components/contracts/NetworkConfiguration.tsx` to allow organizations to enable/disable networks, configure Alchemy settings (if applicable), and view network status/cost estimates.
- [ ] **Contract Deployment Interface Implementation**:
    - [ ] Create `src/components/contracts/ContractDeployer.tsx` to guide organizations through the contract deployment workflow, including network/factory selection, parameter input, deployment preview, gas estimation, and transaction execution.
    - [ ] Implement the backend Parse Cloud Function for `deployOrgContract` to handle the actual contract deployment logic.
- [ ] **Deployed Contracts Dashboard Implementation**:
    - [ ] Develop `src/components/contracts/DeployedContractsList.tsx` to provide a dashboard for organizations to view their deployed contracts, including details, network badges, block explorer links, and quick action buttons.

## II. Phase 3: Contract Interaction - Write Operations

- [ ] **Contract Explorer (Write Operations) Enhancement**:
    - [ ] Extend existing `src/components/contracts/ContractExplorer.tsx` or create new components to enable interaction with write operations on smart contracts.
- [ ] **Alchemy Integration Service for Write Operations**:
    - [ ] Fully implement the `executeCall` method within `parse-server/cloud/services/alchemyService.js` to handle the execution of write operations against the blockchain.
- [ ] **Wallet Integration**:
    - [ ] Integrate with popular wallet providers (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect) to facilitate transaction signing.
- [ ] **Transaction Building and Signing UI/Logic**:
    - [ ] Develop the necessary user interface and backend logic for building and signing blockchain transactions.
- [ ] **Multi-signature (Multi-sig) Support**:
    - [ ] Implement workflows and logic to support multi-signature transactions where multiple approvals are required.

## III. Phase 4: Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- [ ] **Event Monitoring and Webhooks**:
    - [ ] Implement a system to monitor blockchain events and trigger webhooks for external services or internal processing.
- [ ] **Batch Contract Operations**:
    - [ ] Develop capabilities to perform multiple contract operations in a single batch transaction.
- [ ] **Custom RPC Endpoints**:
    - [ ] Add support for organizations to configure and use their own custom RPC endpoints.
- [ ] **Contract Verification Integration**:
    - [ ] Integrate with external services (e.g., Etherscan verify API) to allow for automatic contract source code verification.
