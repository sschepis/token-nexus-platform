# Production Deployment - Remaining Tasks Checklist

This document outlines the remaining tasks for achieving successful and secure production deployment, based on the `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` and cross-referenced with actual code status from other plan analyses. It's critical to note that several "Completed" items in the original document are, in fact, still outstanding.

## I. Priority 1 - Critical Fixes (Still Outstanding)

These are issues highlighted as "Completed" in the original guide but are *still incomplete* based on code analysis in related plans (`FINDINGS.md`, `MOCK_API_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`). These must be resolved **before** production deployment.

- [ ] **1. Debug Code Removal**:
    - [ ] Systematically audit and remove all `console.log` statements and other exposed debug information (e.g., `console.debug`, debug objects) from all production-bound code.
    - [ ] Ensure robust environment checks are in place to prevent any debug output in production builds. (As per `FINDINGS.md` and `_app.tsx` analysis).
- [ ] **2. Development Tools Security**:
    - [ ] Implement a `DevToolsWrapper` component or equivalent robust security measures (e.g., environmental checks in Next.js pages/APIs, conditional compilation) to:
        - [ ] Restrict access to all `/dev/*` pages (`src/pages/dev/debug-settings.tsx`, `src/pages/dev/api-testing.tsx`, etc.) to authenticated system administrators only in development.
        - [ ] Completely disable, remove, or render empty content for these pages in production builds.
    - [ ] Ensure specific debug settings and test endpoints (e.g., `src/pages/api/test-status.ts`) are entirely inaccessible or return 404s in production. (As per `FINDINGS.md`).
- [ ] **3. Mock Data Dependencies**:
    - [ ] Replace all remaining hardcoded mock data and mock API calls in production-bound frontend components with data fetched from real Parse APIs or appropriate backend services. This includes, but is not limited to:
        - [ ] `src/pages/reports.tsx` (chart data).
        - [ ] `src/components/pages/ComponentLibrary.tsx` (custom components, custom objects).
        - [ ] `src/components/pages/ObjectManager.tsx` (custom objects).
        - [ ] `src/components/pages/PageBuilder.tsx` (custom objects).
        - [ ] `src/components/object-manager/ObjectRecordViewer.tsx` (records and fields).
    - [ ] Ensure `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_API` is correctly configured for development vs. production environments. (As detailed in `MOCK_API_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`).
- [ ] **4. File System Dependencies**:
    - [ ] Replace all direct file system operations within Next.js API routes (e.g., `src/pages/api/app-status.ts`, `src/pages/api/setup/update-platform-state.ts`) with database-backed solutions or environment variables for state management. This ensures compatibility with serverless and cloud environments. (As per `FINDINGS.md`).

## II. Priority 2 - Important (From Original Plan's "REMAINING TASKS")

- [ ] **1. Complex App Initialization**:
    - [ ] Refactor the complex `useEffect` logic in `src/pages/_app.tsx` into smaller, more focused custom hooks or utility functions to improve readability and maintainability.
    - [ ] Implement more widespread and granular error boundaries (`React.ErrorBoundary`) across critical application components to gracefully handle rendering errors without crashing the entire application.
- [ ] **2. Global Store Access Pattern**:
    - [ ] Remove the direct global exposure of the Redux store (e.g., `(window as any).__REDUX_STORE__ = store;` in `src/store/store.ts`).
    - [ ] Transition to standard React context or a more controlled dependency injection pattern for accessing the Redux store or its dispatcher in areas where direct import is currently not feasible.
- [ ] **3. Performance Optimization**:
    - [ ] Implement comprehensive code splitting strategies using dynamic imports for large and heavy components (e.g., GrapesJS editor, Ethers.js, data visualization libraries from `recharts`).
    - [ ] Prioritize route-based code splitting to ensure only necessary code is loaded for each page.
    - [ ] Further optimize overall bundle size using advanced tree shaking techniques.
    - [ ] Implement proper caching mechanisms for static assets, API responses, and frequently accessed components to improve load times and responsiveness.

## III. Priority 3 - Minor (From Original Plan's "REMAINING TASKS")

- [ ] **1. Bundle Optimization (Cont.)**:
    - [ ] Continue fine-tuning tree shaking configurations for all large libraries to minimize final bundle size.
    - [ ] Implement a lazy loading strategy specifically for development tools if they are conditionally included in non-production builds.
    - [ ] Introduce image optimization pipelines (e.g., image compression, responsive images) for all visual assets.
- [ ] **2. Monitoring Setup**:
    - [ ] Implement production-grade logging framework (e.g., structured logging, log levels) to provide actionable insights without exposing sensitive data.
    - [ ] Integrate a dedicated error tracking system (e.g., Sentry, Bugsnag) to capture, report, and analyze production errors.
    - [ ] Configure a comprehensive performance monitoring solution (e.g., New Relic, Datadog, or custom metrics) to track key application performance indicators (APIs, page loads, component rendering).
