    - [ ] `BranchManager.tsx` (branch/merge functionality)
    - [ ] `RollbackSystem.tsx` (rollback capabilities)
- [ ] **Advanced Design Tools (Missing Files - continue in `src/components/page-builder/enhanced/`)**:
    - [ ] `AdvancedTypography.tsx`
    - [ ] `ColorPaletteManager.tsx`
    - [ ] `LayoutGridSystem.tsx`

## V. File Structure & Component Library Updates

- [ ] **Create Missing Directories**:
    - [ ] `src/components/page-builder/enhanced/`
    - [ ] `src/components/page-builder/plugins/`
    - [ ] `src/components/page-builder/themes/`
    - [ ] `src/components/page-builder/utils/`
