# AI-Driven Org Assistant: Remaining Tasks Checklist

This document outlines the remaining tasks for realizing the full design of the AI-Driven Org Assistant, based on the `AI_ORG_ASSISTANT_DESIGN.md` document and its relation to the `AI_ASSISTANT_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`.

## Core Component Implementation (Completing the Design)

- [ ] **UI/Chat Interface Enhancements:**
    - [ ] Implement enhanced frontend components for user interaction, including advanced chat features, settings integration, and action approval dialogs. (Refer to `AI_ASSISTANT_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` for specific frontend components).
- [ ] **API Server/Gateway Adaptations:**
    - [ ] Verify or implement any necessary changes in the API Server/Gateway to fully support the communication flow and request routing for the Org Assistant Service.
- [x] **LLM Proxy & Orchestration (Full Implementation):**
- [x] Realize the comprehensive `LLM Proxy & Orchestration` component (e.g., `UnifiedLLMService`) that manages multi-provider LLM communication, advanced prompt engineering, and iterative tool calling. This includes:
- [x] Consolidating OpenAI and Anthropic integrations under a single service.
- [x] Implementing a robust provider routing and management system.
- [ ] **Enhanced Tool Execution:**
    - [ ] Implement the `EnhancedToolExecutor` with advanced validation and explicit approval workflows. This involves:
        - [ ] Developing backend services for action approval and validation.
        - [ ] Integrating a frontend dialog for user approval of sensitive actions.
- [ ] **Schema Registry Advanced Features:**
    - [ ] Extend the existing schema registry (`getAvailableSchemas` function) to include:
        - [ ] Mechanisms for automatic discovery of schemas from diverse data sources beyond existing `CustomObject` definitions.
        - [ ] Functionality for manual configuration and augmentation of schemas by administrators.
        - [ ] Consideration for schema versioning as data structures evolve.

## Key Considerations & Future Enhancements (Conceptual to Realized)

- [ ] **Schema Versioning:** Implement a strategy for handling schema versioning as data structures evolve.
- [ ] **Tool Versioning:** Implement mechanisms for managing tool versioning alongside schema changes.
- [ ] **Context Window Management:** Develop strategies for managing context windows for long conversations, including summarization or selective inclusion of history/schema.
- [ ] **Disambiguation:** Implement logic for the assistant to ask clarifying questions when user queries are ambiguous.
- [ ] **Advanced Error Handling & Fallbacks:** Develop more graceful handling of tool failures, permission denials, and LLM errors, including robust fallback mechanisms.
- [ ] **Comprehensive Logging & Auditing:** Ensure all actions taken by the assistant, particularly write operations, are thoroughly logged and auditable.
- [ ] **Feedback Mechanism:** Implement a system to allow users to provide feedback on assistant responses for continuous improvement.
- [ ] **Advanced Query Capabilities:** Explore and implement capabilities for more complex queries, aggregations, and joins.
- [ ] **Proactive Assistance:** Research and develop features for the assistant to proactively offer suggestions or information based on user context or events.
