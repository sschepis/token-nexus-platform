- [04-controller-system.md](./04-controller-system.md) - BasePageController architecture
- [05-app-runtime-framework.md](./05-app-runtime-framework.md) - App execution environment

### Feature Components
- [06-dashboard-widgets.md](./06-dashboard-widgets.md) - Dashboard and widget system
- [07-token-management.md](./07-token-management.md) - Token creation, deployment, analytics
- [08-blockchain-integration.md](./08-blockchain-integration.md) - Wallet, smart contracts, multi-network
- [09-content-management.md](./09-content-management.md) - Object manager, file management, page builder
- [10-ai-assistant.md](./10-ai-assistant.md) - AI integration and automation

### Standard Applications

- [13-marketplace.md](./13-marketplace.md) - App marketplace and store

### Integration & Infrastructure
- [14-integrations.md](./14-integrations.md) - Third-party APIs, webhooks, OAuth
- [15-security-compliance.md](./15-security-compliance.md) - Security measures, audit, compliance
- [16-performance-monitoring.md](./16-performance-monitoring.md) - Performance, logging, monitoring
- [17-deployment-infrastructure.md](./17-deployment-infrastructure.md) - Deployment, CI/CD, infrastructure

## Analysis Methodology

Each analysis file follows this structure:

### 1. Design Requirements
- What the documentation specifies should be implemented
- Key features and functionality requirements
- Architecture and design patterns expected

### 2. Current Implementation Status
- What has been actually implemented in the codebase
- Working features and components
- Partial implementations and their status

### 3. Gap Analysis
- **Missing Features**: What's completely missing
- **Incomplete Features**: What's partially implemented
- **Implementation Issues**: What's implemented but has problems
- **Architecture Gaps**: Where implementation doesn't match design

### 4. Priority Assessment
- **Critical**: Must be completed for beta
- **High**: Important for beta functionality
- **Medium**: Enhances beta but not blocking
- **Low**: Nice to have for beta

### 5. Implementation Recommendations
- Specific tasks needed to close gaps
- Estimated effort and complexity
- Dependencies and prerequisites
- Suggested implementation order

## Summary Findings

Based on the comprehensive analysis, the platform is approximately **78% complete** as stated in the project summary, but there are significant gaps in several areas that need to be addressed for a working beta:

### Critical Gaps (Must Fix for Beta)
1. **App Runtime Framework Integration** - While the framework exists, integration with the main platform is incomplete
2. **Token Management Backend** - Missing deployment and analytics backend services
3. **Page Builder Integration** - Frontend exists but backend integration is incomplete
4. **Standard Apps Backend** - Several standard applications missing backend services

### High Priority Gaps (Important for Beta)
1. **Dashboard Widget Persistence** - Widgets exist but layout saving is incomplete
2. **Multi-Network Blockchain Support** - Limited to single network currently
3. **Advanced Permissions** - Basic RBAC exists but granular permissions incomplete
4. **Performance Optimization** - Several performance bottlenecks identified

### Medium Priority Gaps (Enhances Beta)
1. **Advanced Analytics** - Basic reporting exists but advanced analytics missing
2. **Content Workflows** - Basic content management exists but workflows missing
3. **Enhanced Security Features** - Core security exists but advanced features missing

## Next Steps

1. Review each individual gap analysis file
2. Prioritize gaps based on beta requirements
3. Create detailed implementation tasks
4. Estimate effort and timeline
5. Plan implementation sprints
