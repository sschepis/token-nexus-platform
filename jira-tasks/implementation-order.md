## Implementation Strategy

### Parallel Tracks
Some features can be developed in parallel by different teams:

**Track 1 (Infrastructure Team):**
- Deployment & Infrastructure
- Performance Monitoring
- Security & Compliance

**Track 2 (Platform Team):**
- Authentication
- User Management
- Organization Management
- API Management

**Track 3 (Feature Team):**
- Dashboard Customization
- Content Management
- AI Assistant

**Track 4 (Blockchain Team):**
- Blockchain Integration
- Smart Contract Studio
- Digital Assets

### Critical Path
The minimum viable platform requires:
1. Deployment Infrastructure
2. Security & Compliance
3. Authentication
4. User Management
5. API Management
6. App Runtime Framework

## Risk-Based Ordering Rationale

1. **Infrastructure First:** Prevents costly migrations later
2. **Security Early:** Avoids vulnerabilities and compliance issues
3. **User System Next:** Enables all user-facing features
4. **APIs Before Apps:** Provides foundation for extensibility
5. **Blockchain When Stable:** Complex features need solid base
6. **Advanced Features Last:** Can iterate based on user feedback

This order minimizes technical debt, reduces rework, and ensures each phase builds on a solid foundation from the previous phase.
