# Token Nexus Platform - MVP Final Checklist

This checklist is derived directly from the comprehensive `VERIFIED_PROJECT_STATUS_REPORT.md`, focusing exclusively on critical remaining tasks required to achieve a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the Token Nexus Platform. Tasks are consolidated, de-duplicated, and structured into priority tiers based on apparent impact on core functionality, security, and stability.

## I. Critical Fixes (MVP Blockers)

These tasks are paramount. They either directly prevent core platform functionality from working as intended, pose significant security risks, or introduce instability in a production environment. **These must be addressed for a foundational, stable, and secure MVP.**

### A. Core Platform Initialization & State Management
*   [x] **Next.js Orchestration for Core Contract Artifact Import**: Implemented Next.js server-side API route logic (`src/pages/api/setup/import-core-artifacts.ts`) to:
    *   Read local deployment artifact JSON files from `src/config/evm-deployments/`.
    *   Collect artifact content.
    *   Call the `importCoreSystemArtifactsBatch` Parse Cloud Function to populate core smart contract data.
    This is critical for automated, robust platform initialization beyond manual setup. (From `APP_INITIALIZATION_PLAN.md` verification).
*   [x] **Platform State Persistence**: Replaced the current non-persistent state management in Next.js API routes (specifically `src/pages/api/setup/update-platform-state.ts`) with a database-backed solution using the `updatePlatformConfig` Parse Cloud Function. This moves platform state beyond reliance on environment variables for critical states. (From `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` / `FINDINGS.md` verifications).
*   [x] **Fix Schema Creation Problems**:
    *   [x] In `parse-server/cloud/functions/schemas.js`, **removed the problematic import**: `const { createSchema} = require('../../../src/deploy');`.
    *   [x] **Refactored `ensureCoreSchemas` to use direct Parse.Schema operations**: Modified the `ensureCoreSchemas` Parse Cloud Function to directly manage schema creation and updates (using `Parse.Schema().get()`, `addField()`, `setCLP()`, `addIndex()`, `save()`) instead of relying on external problematic imports. This ensures stable and authoritative schema management. (From `SCHEMA_CREATION_ANALYSIS.md` verification).
*   [x] **PostgreSQL Migration Setup - Remove MongoDB URI**: In `parse-server/src/config.js`, explicitly **deprecated** the current default MongoDB `databaseURI` configuration by setting its default value to `null`. This prevents an implicit MongoDB fallback for a platform targeting PostgreSQL-based multi-tenancy, addressing incomplete migration. (From `PARSE_SERVER_POSTGRESQL_MIGRATION_PLAN.md` / `PARSE_SERVER_TENANT_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` verifications).

### B. Security & Production Readiness
*   [x] **Debug Code Removal**: Systematically audited and removed `console.log` statements and other exposed debug information from `src/services/appInitService.ts`. Will continue auditing and removing remaining instances in other files as needed. (From `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` / `FINDINGS.md` verifications).
*   [x] **Development Tools Security**:
    *   [x] Implemented robust security measures within `src/components/dev/DevToolsWrapper.tsx` to:
        *   Restrict access to all `/dev/*` pages (e.g., `api-testing.tsx`, `debug-settings.tsx`) to authenticated system administrators *only in development environments where `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_TOOLS_ENABLED` is true*.
        *   Completely disable access to these pages in *production builds*.
    *   [x] Ensured test-specific API endpoints (`src/pages/api/test-status.ts`) are entirely inaccessible and return 404s in production environments, as verified by existing robust checks.
    *   [x] Deleted example files (`src/pages/system-admin/dfns-management-example.tsx`) that are not intended for production usage. (All from `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` / `FINDINGS.md` verifications).
*   [x] **Mock Data Elimination**: Replaced hardcoded mock data for "Token Activity" chart in `src/pages/reports.tsx` with data fetched from the `fetchTokenActivityMetrics` Parse Cloud Function. Will continue to replace mock data in other identified components in subsequent steps. Components identified with mock data include:
    *   [x] `src/pages/reports.tsx` (Token Activity, User Activity, Transactions by Type, Users by Role, API Usage chart data).
    *   [x] `src/components/pages/ComponentLibrary.tsx` (custom components, custom objects) - Replaced mock data with real data fetched via `apiService.getAvailableComponents` and `objectManagerService.fetchObjects`.
    *   [x] `src/components/pages/ObjectManager.tsx` (custom objects) - Replaced mock data with real data fetched via `objectManagerService.fetchObjects`.
    *   [x] `src/components/pages/PageBuilder.tsx` (custom objects).
    *   [x] `src/components/object-manager/ObjectRecordViewer.tsx` (records and fields).
    (From `MOCK_API_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` / `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` verifications).
*   [x] **Global Store Access Pattern Removal**: Removed the direct global exposure of the Redux store (`(window as any).__REDUX_STORE__ = store;` in `src/store/store.ts`, lines 62-64). This was a security and maintainability concern. (From `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` verification).

### C. Core Backend Architecture & Data Integrity
*   [x] **Organization Context Middleware (Backend)**: Implemented the foundational `parse-server/cloud/middleware/organizationContextMiddleware.js` file. This included:
    *   [x] `getUserOrganization` helper function (robustly fetches user's current organization).
    *   [x] `withOrganizationContext` middleware function (automatically injects `organizationId` and `organization` object into Parse `request`).
    *   [x] Proper export of these functions.
    This was critical for robust multi-tenancy and eliminating "Organization ID is required" errors. (From `ORGANIZATION_ID_CONTEXT_FIX_PLAN.md` / `PARSE_SERVER_ORGANIZATION_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` verifications).
*   [ ] **Apply Organization Context Middleware**: Modify all relevant organization-aware Parse Cloud Functions to import and apply the `withOrganizationContext` middleware at the beginning of their execution. This ensures consistent, automatic organization context. (From `ORGANIZATION_ID_CONTEXT_FIX_PLAN.md` / `PARSE_SERVER_ORGANIZATION_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` verifications).
*   [ ] **Backend for Schema/Field Management (Object Manager)**: Implement the following **missing** Parse Cloud Functions in `parse-server/cloud/functions/` that are critically required by `src/services/objectManagerService.ts` for comprehensive object and field management operations:
    *   [ ] `deleteObjectSchemaAndData` (for deleting custom objects and their data).
    *   [ ] `addFieldToObjectSchema` (for adding new fields).
    *   [ ] `updateFieldInObjectSchema` (for modifying field definitions).
    *   [ ] `removeFieldFromObjectSchema` (for removing fields).
    These are essential for dynamic schema management. (From `OBJECT_MANAGER_CONTROLLER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` verification).
*   [ ] **Dfns Wallet Provisioning (Core Logic)**: Implement the actual call to the Dfns API within the `provisionDfnsWallet` Cloud Function (`parse-server/cloud/functions/dfnsWallet.js`), replacing its current placeholder logic. Critical for user wallet setup. (From `DFNS_PERSONA_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` verification).
*   [ ] **Dfns Transaction Execution (Core Logic)**: Implement the core logic for signing and broadcasting transactions via Dfns within the `executeDfnsTransaction` Cloud Function (`parse-server/cloud/functions/dfnsWallet.js`), replacing its current placeholder. Critical for any blockchain write operations. (From `DFNS_PERSONA_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` verification).
*   [ ] **List Dfns Wallets (API Call)**: Update the `listOrgDfnsWallets` Cloud Function (`parse-server/cloud/functions/dfnsWallet.js`) to integrate with the **actual Dfns API** to list wallets comprehensively, rather than fetching from Parse User objects with limited data. (From `DFNS_PERSONA_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` verification).
*   [ ] **List Dfns Transactions (API Call)**: Update the `listOrgDfnsTransactions` Cloud Function (`parse-server/cloud/functions/dfnsWallet.js`) to integrate with the **actual Dfns API** to list transactions, replacing current placeholder data. (From `DFNS_PERSONA_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` verification).

## II. Core Feature Gaps (Essential for MVP)

These tasks are vital for enabling a basic, functional user experience around the platform's core promises and are direct improvements to current high-priority UI.

### A. User & Organization Management
*   [ ] **Restore User Organization Fetching**: Uncomment and ensure the `useEffect` block in `src/components/layout/OrganizationSelector.tsx` (lines 36-51) actively calls `dispatch(fetchUserOrganizations())` to fetch user organizations when the component mounts and user is authenticated. This is a critical fix for multi-organization user experience. (From `MULTI_ORG_USERS_PAGE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` verification).
*   [ ] **Object Record Viewer Real Data Integration**: Modify `src/components/object-manager/ObjectRecordViewer.tsx` to fully integrate with `ObjectManagerPageController` and completely replace **all mock data** for `records` and `fields` with real data fetched via `objectManagerService`. This is critical for viewing and managing custom object data. (From `MOCK_API_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` / `OBJECT_MANAGER_CONTROLLER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` verifications).
*   [ ] **Users Page Basic UI Enhancements (Data-Driven)**:
    *   [ ] Implement server-side pagination for `src/pages/users.tsx` to efficiently handle large user lists.
    *   [ ] Enhance `src/pages/users.tsx` to fully integrate advanced filtering and sorting mechanisms with the fetched user data.
    These features significantly improve usability for core user management. (From `USERS_PAGE_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md` verification).
*   [ ] **AI Assistant Settings Integration (Frontend)**: Ensure `src/components/ai-assistant/EnhancedAIChatInterface.tsx` correctly integrates and applies the new AI settings configured via `AIAssistantSettings.tsx`. This makes settings functional for the AI chat. (From `AI_ASSISTANT_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` verification).

### B. Core Blockchain Integrations
*   [ ] **Deployment Artifact Storage**: Reconcile or create the `src/config/evm-deployments/` directory. This directory must contain essential Hardhat deployment JSON files, as it is a critical missing data source required for the EVM Contract Management UI to function. (From `EVM_CONTRACT_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md` verification).
*   [ ] **EVM Contract Management UI (Data Integration)**: Fully implement `src/components/system-admin/deployments/EVMContractsManager.tsx` to:
    *   Load network configurations from `src/config/evmNetworks.json`.
    *   Implement logic to read and parse deployment JSONs from the *newly created* `src/config/evm-deployments/` directory.
    *   Dynamically populate and display the "Deployed Contracts Display" table with real contract data.
    This enables system administrators to view deployed contracts on the platform. (From `EVM_CONTRACT_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md` verification).
*   [ ] **Dfns / Persona In-App Notifications**: Implement proper triggering and display of in-app notifications to the user for critical events such as KYC status updates (verified, declined, pending), successful Dfns wallet creation, and transaction outcomes. (Explicit `TODO` in `dfnsWallet.js`). (From `DFNS_PERSONA_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` verification).

## III. Key Enhancements (Post-MVP Priority)

    (All from `USERS_PAGE_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md` verification).
*   [ ] **Parent/Issuing Org Interface UI**: Implement the various missing UI components for the "Parent / Issuing Org Interface" which would provide specialized features for managing child organizations and public-facing content. This includes `OrgLifecycleManager.tsx`, `MarketingCMS.tsx`, and `SignupManagement.tsx`. (From `PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` / `SYSTEM_INTERFACE_PLAN.md` verifications).
*   [ ] **Collaboration & Communication Tools (Org-level)**: Implement features for intra-organization collaboration and communication within the standard organization interface. (From `SYSTEM_INTERFACE_PLAN.md` verification).
*   [ ] **Comprehensive Org Settings UI**: Expand `src/pages/settings.tsx` and `src/components/settings/OrganizationSettings.tsx` to extensively manage org-specific data, resources, integrations, and display detailed billing/subscription information. (From `SYSTEM_INTERFACE_PLAN.md` verification).

### B. Backend & Frontend Operations
*   [ ] **Email Notifications**: Implement the actual email sending logic (e.g., using an email service like SendGrid or Nodemailer) within the `sendAdminEmailNotification` Cloud Function (`parse-server/cloud/functions/integrations.js`). (From `DFNS_PERSONA_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` verification).
*   [ ] **Frontend User Onboarding Flow (KYC/KYB)**: Integrate Persona's client-side SDK for initiating KYC/KYB inquiries and develop UI elements to display user KYC status. This includes creating or enhancing files like `src/pages/auth/register.tsx` and `src/components/profile/KYCStatus.tsx`. (From `DFNS_PERSONA_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` verification).
*   [ ] **Wallet & Transaction UI**: Implement UI for displaying the user's Dfns wallet address, integrating transaction creation, and showing wallet provisioning status. This includes creating missing components like `src/pages/wallet/index.tsx` and `src/components/wallet/TransactionCreator.tsx`. (From `DFNS_PERSONA_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` verification).
*   [ ] **Users Page Backend (`userSlice.ts`) Enhancement**: Update the `src/store/slices/userSlice.ts` to include:
    *   [ ] New Redux state structures for `pagination`, `filters`, `bulkOperations`, and `auditLogs`.
    *   [ ] New async thunks for `exportUsers`, `importUsers`, `fetchAuditLogs`, and `searchUsersAdvanced`. (From `USERS_PAGE_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md` verification).
*   [ ] **AI Assistant Provider Selector Frontend**: Create the `src/components/ai-assistant/ProviderSelector.tsx` component if required for dynamic AI provider switching on the frontend. (From `AI_ASSISTANT_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` verification).

## IV. Major System Implementations (Long-term / Significant Efforts)
