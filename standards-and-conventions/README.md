## Quick Start Guide

### For New Developers

1. **Start with Core Concepts**: Read [Organization-Centric Pages](./02-organization-centric-pages.md) to understand the basic platform patterns
2. **Choose Your Extension Type**: Select the appropriate documentation based on what you're building
3. **Follow the Implementation Checklist**: Each document includes a comprehensive checklist
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Use the [Testing Standards](./25-testing-standards.md) to ensure quality

### For Experienced Developers

1. **Review Architecture Patterns**: Understand the platform's modular architecture
2. **Check Security Requirements**: All extensions must follow security standards
3. **Implement AI Integration**: Ensure your extensions work with the AI assistant
4. **Follow Performance Guidelines**: Optimize for the platform's performance requirements

## Platform Architecture Overview

The Token Nexus Platform is designed as a highly modular, extensible system with the following key architectural principles:

### Multi-Tenant Architecture
- **Organization Isolation**: All data and functionality is scoped to organizations
- **Permission-Based Access**: Role-based access control at all levels
- **Secure Multi-Tenancy**: Complete data isolation between organizations

### Extensibility Framework
- **Installable Applications**: Apps can extend both system and organization functionality
- **Plugin Architecture**: Modular components that can be enabled/disabled
- **API-First Design**: All functionality exposed through consistent APIs

### AI-First Platform
- **AI Assistant Integration**: All extensions should integrate with the AI assistant
- **Action-Based Architecture**: Functionality exposed as discoverable actions
- **Natural Language Interface**: Users can interact with extensions through AI

### Security-First Design
- **Zero-Trust Architecture**: All operations validated and authorized
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for all operations
- **Compliance Ready**: Built-in compliance and regulatory features

## Extension Development Lifecycle

### 1. Planning Phase
- Define requirements and scope
- Choose appropriate extension type
- Review relevant standards documentation
- Plan security and permission requirements

### 2. Development Phase
- Follow the appropriate standards document
- Implement required interfaces and patterns
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Include AI assistant integration

### 3. Testing Phase
- Unit tests for all functionality
- Integration tests with platform
- Security testing and validation
- Performance testing and optimization

### 4. Deployment Phase
- Package according to deployment standards
- Document installation and configuration
- Provide user documentation
- Submit for platform approval (if applicable)
