' Notes
note right of UC19 : Package validation includes\nmanifest validation, dependency\nchecks, and security scanning
note right of UC29 : Security context ensures\napplication isolation and\nproper permission enforcement
note right of UC32 : All data operations are\nautomatically scoped to\norganization and application
note right of UC63 : AI assistant integration\nallows natural language\ninteraction with applications
