# UML Diagrams for System-Level Pages

This directory contains comprehensive UML diagrams generated from the `standards-and-conventions/01-system-level-pages.md` document. These diagrams provide visual representations of the Token Nexus Platform's system-level page architecture, security model, and operational workflows.

## Overview

System-level pages in the Token Nexus Platform provide platform-wide administrative functionality with the highest level of security and access control. These diagrams illustrate the complete architecture from security validation to cross-organizational data management.

- **Audit System**: [`SystemAuditLog`](../src/types/SystemAuditLog.ts), [`AuditService`](../src/services/AuditService.ts)

**Relationships**: Inheritance, composition, and dependency relationships between security, controller, and data management components.

### 2. Sequence Diagram (`01-system-level-pages-sequence-diagram.puml`)

**Purpose**: Illustrates the interaction flow between components during system-level page operations.

**Key Flows**:
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Multi-factor authentication and permission validation
- **Data Loading**: Cross-organizational data retrieval with security checks
- **User Actions**: System operations like user suspension with comprehensive auditing
- **Export Operations**: Secure data export with audit logging
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Health monitoring and security event handling

**Security Features**: Enhanced security headers, MFA verification, and comprehensive audit logging at every step.

### 3. Component Diagram (`01-system-level-pages-component-diagram.puml`)

**Purpose**: Shows the high-level architecture and component relationships within security boundaries.

**Architecture Layers**:
- **Frontend Layer**: System admin interface with security validation
- **Controller Layer**: System page controllers with action management
- **Security Layer**: Authentication, MFA, permissions, and session management
- **Platform Services**: Cross-org data access and system health monitoring
- **Audit & Compliance**: Comprehensive logging and security event monitoring
- **AI Integration**: AI assistant with system-level actions

**Security Boundaries**: Clear separation of system admin, platform, and audit security boundaries.

### 4. State Diagram (`01-system-level-pages-state-diagram.puml`)

**Purpose**: Represents the various states and transitions in system page lifecycle and security validation.

**State Categories**:
- **Page Access States**: Authentication, MFA verification, session validation
- **System Page States**: Controller initialization, data loading, active operations
- **Security States**: Session management, security alerts, lockout procedures
- **Action States**: Permission validation, audit logging, result processing

**Security Transitions**: Automatic transitions to security lockout states on violations.

### 5. Activity Diagram (`01-system-level-pages-activity-diagram.puml`)

**Purpose**: Shows the workflow and decision points in system-level page operations.

**Activity Flows**:
- **Security Validation**: Multi-layered security checks with MFA
- **Controller Initialization**: System controller setup and action registration
- **Data Operations**: Cross-organizational queries with security filtering
- **Action Processing**: Comprehensive validation, execution, and auditing
- **Monitoring Activities**: Real-time health and security monitoring

**Parallel Activities**: Concurrent monitoring of system health, security events, and session status.

### 6. Use Case Diagram (`01-system-level-pages-use-case-diagram.puml`)

**Purpose**: Identifies actors and their interactions with system-level functionality.

**Actor Hierarchy**:
- **System Administrator**: Full platform access with all permissions
- **Platform Monitor**: System health and performance monitoring
- **Security Admin**: Security event monitoring and access control
- **User Manager**: User administration across organizations
- **Organization Manager**: Organization-level administration

**Use Case Categories**:
- **Security & Access Control**: Authentication, permissions, session management
- **User Administration**: Cross-org user management and bulk operations
- **Organization Administration**: Multi-org settings and analytics
- **Platform Monitoring**: System health, performance, and alerting
- **Audit & Compliance**: Comprehensive logging and reporting
- **AI Integration**: AI-powered system operations and insights

## Key Architecture Principles

### 1. Security-First Design
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Required for all system-level operations
- **Permission Hierarchy**: Role-based access control with system-level permissions
- **Session Management**: Enhanced security with shorter timeouts
- **Comprehensive Auditing**: All actions logged with full context

### 2. Cross-Organization Access
- **Multi-Tenant Queries**: Secure access to data across all organizations
- **Data Aggregation**: Platform-wide statistics and metrics
- **Organization Filtering**: Selective data access by organization
- **Security Boundaries**: Proper isolation while enabling cross-org operations

### 3. Real-Time Monitoring
- **System Health**: Continuous monitoring of platform performance
- **Security Events**: Real-time security event detection and alerting
- **Session Tracking**: Active session monitoring and management
- **Performance Metrics**: Response time, error rate, and uptime tracking

### 4. AI Integration
- **Natural Language Interface**: AI assistant for system operations
- **Pattern Analysis**: AI-powered user activity and anomaly detection
- **Automated Insights**: System health and security recommendations
- **Action Automation**: AI-driven routine task automation

## Implementation Guidelines

### Security Requirements
1. All system pages must extend [`BaseSystemController`](../src/controllers/base/BaseSystemController.ts)
2. MFA verification required for all operations
3. Comprehensive audit logging with risk assessment
4. Session timeout enforcement (30 minutes maximum)
5. IP address and user agent tracking

### Component Structure
1. Security validation at multiple layers
2. Cross-organization context management
3. Real-time health monitoring integration
4. AI assistant action registration
5. Enhanced error handling with security focus

### Data Access Patterns
1. System-level API calls with enhanced security headers
2. Cross-organizational data aggregation
3. Security filtering at the database level
4. Performance optimization for multi-tenant queries
5. Data retention and consistency management
